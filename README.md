# Next-Generation-Neural-Data-Analysis-NGNDA-
Tools for massive parallel analysis of brain data
The NGNDA repository includes Matlab codes for multiscale (multiband) connectivity analysis of human electrophysiological (EEG) and fMRI data. Version 1.0 of the pipeline includes codes for preprocessing large-scale fMRI datasets such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset and estimating resting-state connectomes and their network properties, offering options for different connectivity methods and comparisons. Version 1.0 also includes codes for connectivity analysis of very high-dimensional time series (human EEG) using high-resolution processing in time. 
The repository is organized into 2 folders, NGNDA-EEG and NGNDA-fMRI, each containing modality-specific codes and a list of the codes with details for use.
